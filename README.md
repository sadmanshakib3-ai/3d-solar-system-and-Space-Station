# 3d-solar-system-and-Space-Station
This project is a 3D Solar System simulation featuring planets revolving around the sun, along with a simple space station designed using square primitives. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate fundamental concepts of computer graphics, such as 3D transformations, rotations, scaling, and hierarchical modeling. The solar system part shows orbital motion of planets, while the space station illustrates how basic shapes can be combined to form complex structures. This project highlights both animation and static modeling in a single scene

Features:

Solar System Core 
The sun at the center, which has a glowing effect using RGB colour, is positioned at the center
Planets orbiting around the sun at different speeds and distances
Each planet has its orbital radius
Circular paths drawn around the Sun

Space Station 
The Body is made of squares to form the main cabin
Long rectangles and squares are attached on both sides to create solar panels
A station can rotate around the Earth or float near it
       
Interaction & Visuals
Camera Controls


Zoom in/out to view planets and stations closely.


Rotate the whole scene in 3D.


Lighting & Shading


The Sun acts as the main light source.


Planets and the station cast shadows or glow depending on position.


Optional Features


Space station orbiting Earth


Option to pause/play animation.
